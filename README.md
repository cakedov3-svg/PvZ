# PvZ
PvZ simulator using a 2D interface and a turn-based playing system

Project done in TP1 during my second year at university.
It implements a 2D and turn-based version of the popular mobile game "Plants vs Zombies". Using strict OOP and the terminal as a GUI, you can deploy your plants, pickup suncoins and let the zombies advance, trying to kill them
before they get to your house. You can set the difficulty, choosing between EASY, HARD or INSANE, and also select a seed (both parameters are needed).
